        <h1>Keyboard Security System</h1>
        <div class="textContainer">
            <p>
                This is a project I worked on in a team of three from November to
                December 2017. A keyboard was connected to an Onion Omega, which
                was used to lock and unlock the keyboard's functionality. When in
                the locked state, the Omega would block off the keyboard's input signals.
                When unlocked, the keyboard could be used to type text onto an
                OLED display connected to the Omega. In addition, log files
                which contained timestamps of when the system was used as well
                as statistics computed on usage patterns was output to the Omega's
                internal storage on a weekly basis.

            </br>
            </br>

            </br>
            <h2>Locking System</h2>
            </br>
            <p>
                The lock system for the Omega is based off the following statemachine:
            </p>
            </br>
            <img src="images/statemachine.png"/>
            </br>
            <p>
                During the unlocked state, the Omega constantly searches for input
                from the keyboard. When a key is pressed, the Omega converts the
                raw input signal to an ASCII character, which is then checked against
                the password array. If a set of inputs is equal to the password
                array, the system is unlocked. If an incorrect password is entered
                more than three times, then the device locks for 60 seconds, during which
                the user is unable to try unlocking the device.
            </p>
            </br>
            <h2>OLED Display</h2>
            </br>
                <img src="images/devicelocked.jpg"/>
            </br>
            <p>
                The OLED display was programmed in C++ using the Onion I2C and OLED
                Expansion libraries. The libraries didn't support the use of the
                OLED as a typing display, so text-editing features such as backspace,
                line break, and capitalization had to be manually implemented through
                the use of loops. Pressing the 'esc' key would exit the text-display
                and lock the system.
            </p>
            </br>
            <h2>Logging and Statistics</h2>
            </br>
            <p>
            Log files consisting of user activiting logs and usage statistics were
            output to the Omega's internal storage on a weekly basis. Statistics
            such as words per hour and standard standard deviation were calculated
            using various functions and arrays.
            </p>
            </br>
            <img src="images/functionsdiagram.jpg" id="fullsize"/>
            </br>
            <p>
                As shown by the above diagram, each time the Omega detects input
                from the keyboard, functions to get the current time are called, and
                the the statistics and logs are updated for the current input and
                time.
            </p>
