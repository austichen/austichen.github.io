                This is a project I completed in summer 2016 which used a Raspberry
                Pi as a signal to control lights wirelessly. Additionally, I used
                crontab to implement a feature which turned the lights on and off
                automatically and specified times.

            The basic materials for the projct consisted of a lamp, a wireless power
            outlet, and the Raspberry Pi with a 433MHz signal sender/receiver module.
            Software wise, Raspbian OS was installed on the Pi.
            </br>
            </br>
            433MHz RF transmitter and receivers were connected to the Raspberry Pi
            through GPIO pins, allowing the Pi to send and receive signals to and
            from the wireless power outlet. To make this functionality useful, RFSniffer
            was used to detect the signals used by the wireless power outlet. The
            wireless power outlet was plugged into a wall outlet, and the lamp was
            plugged into the wireless power outlet. Signals could then be output
            by the Pi to turn the power outlet on and off, which fully implements
            the wireless power outlet feature.

            This project saw several applications around the house. It was used to
            automatically turn on and off an LED house number display that was
            outside the house at specific hours, saving electricity. Also, it was
            used to automatically turn on and off Christmas lights at peak hours
            when the holidy season came around.
